# PE-Malware-Dataset1
This repository contains a multi-feature dataset of Windows PE malware samples. We collected PE malware samples from MalwareBazaar and used pefile library of Python to extract four feature sets. These features can be used for static malware analysis. Moreover, we use VirusTotal API to label these malwares. We categorized them into five families based on majority voting. The details are avaiblae in the paper: 

First feature set (DLLs_Imported.csv file) contains the DLLs imported by each malware family. The first column contains SHA256 values, second column contains the label or family name of the malware while the remaining columns list the names of imported DLLs.

Second feature set (API Functions.csv files) contains the API functions called by these malware alongwith their SHA256 hash values and labels. We divided this feature set into 4 files because of file size limit on GitHub.

Third feature set (Header.csv) contains values of 52 fields of PE header. All the fields are labelled in the CSV file.

Fourth feature set (Section.csv file) contains 10 field values of 10 different PE sections. All the fields are labelled in the CSV file.

The file (VirusTotal_Results.csv) contains the results of API calls to VirusTotal database for finding the families of these malware. The first column contains SHA256 hash, second column the number of virus engines that detected the malware, third column the total number of virus engines used by VirusTotal.
